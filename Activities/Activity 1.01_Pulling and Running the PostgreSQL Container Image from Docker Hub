In this activity, you are asked to start a PostgreSQL version 12 database container
with default credentials.

>>>Note
The official Postgres container image provides many environment
variable overrides you can leverage to configure the PostgreSQL
instance. Review the documentation for the container on Docker
Hub at https://hub.docker.com/_/postgres.

Perform the following steps:
1. Create a Postgres database container instance that will serve as the data tier of
our application stack.
2. Use environment variables to configure the container at runtime to use the
   following database credentials:   
username: panoramic
password: trekking
3. Verify whether the container is running and healthy.

Expected Output:
The following output should be returned on running docker ps command:
CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED
STATUS PORTS NAMES
29f115af8cdd postgres:12 "docker-entrypoint.s…" 4 seconds ago
Up 2 seconds 5432/tcp blissful_kapitsa

Solution:
1. To start the Postgres Docker container, first determine what environment
variables are required to set the default username and password credentials
for the database. Reading through the official Docker Hub page, you can see
that you have configuration options for the POSTGRES_USER and POSTGRES_
PASSWORD environment variables. Pass the environment variables using the -e
flag. The final command to start our Postgres Docker container will be as follows:

$ docker run -itd -e "POSTGRES_USER=panoramic" -e "POSTGRES_PASSWORD=trekking" postgres:12
Running this command will start the container.

2. Execute the docker ps command to verify that it is running and healthy:

$ docker ps
The command should return output like the following:
CONTAINER ID IMAGE COMMAND CREATED
STATUS PORTS NAMES
29f115af8cdd postgres:12 "docker-entrypoint.s…" 4 seconds ago
Up 2 seconds 5432/tcp blissful_kapitsa
It can be seen from the preceding output that the container with the ID
29f115af8cdd is up and running.

In this activity, you have successfully started a PostgreSQL version 12 container that is
part of the Panoramic Trekking App, which will be built over the course of this book.
