Imagine that you want to deploy a PHP welcome page that will greet visitors
based on the date and time using the following logic. Your task is to dockerize the
PHP application given here, using the Apache web server installed on an Ubuntu
base image:
<?php
$hourOfDay = date('H');
if($hourOfDay < 12) {
$message = "Good Morning";
} elseif($hourOfDay > 11 && $hourOfDay < 18) {
$message = "Good Afternoon";
} elseif($hourOfDay > 17){
$message = "Good Evening";
}
echo $message;
?>

Execute the following steps to complete this activity:
1. Create a folder to store the activity files.
2. Create a welcome.php file with the code provided previously.
3. Create a Dockerfile and set up the application with PHP and Apache2 on an
Ubuntu base image.
4. Build and run the Docker image.
5. Once completed, stop and remove the Docker container.
