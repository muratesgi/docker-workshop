This activity will involve accessing the database running inside the container
instance using the PSQL CLI utility. Once you have logged in using the credentials
(panoramic/trekking), you will query for the list of databases running in
the container.

Perform the following steps:
1. Log in to the Postgres database container using the PSQL command-line utility.
2. Once logged in to the database, return a list of databases in Postgres by default.

Note
If you are not familiar with the PSQL CLI, the following is a list of reference
commands to assist you with this activity:
Logging in: psql --username username --password
Listing the database: \l
Quitting the PSQL shell: \q


Solution:
1. Log in to the database instance using docker exec to start the PSQL
shell inside the container, passing in the --username flag and leaving the
--password flag empty:

$ docker exec -it <containerID> psql --username panoramic --password

This should prompt you for the password and start a PSQL shell.
2. Use the \l command to list all the databases:
psql (12.2 (Debian 12.2-2.pgdg100+1))
Type "help" for help.
panoramic=# \l
3. Finally, use the \q shortcut to exit from the shell.
4. Use the docker stop and docker rm commands to stop and clean up the
container instance.
In this activity, you accessed the database running in the container by logging in
using the credentials that were set up in Activity 1.01, Pulling and Running the
PostgreSQL Container Image from Docker Hub. You also listed the databases running
in the container. The activity gave you hands-on experience of how to access the
database running in any container using a PSQL shell.
